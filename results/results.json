At the Bill of Rights Institute, we believe it takes hands-on learning, authentic engagement, and opportunities for students to see themselves as civic leaders. On September 17, more than 750 students in Bay City, Michigan joined us for Civicspalooza, a daylong celebration of Constitution Day filled with civics competitions, debates, civic action workshops, and connections with local leaders. Events like Civicspalooza remind us that civic education is not just about knowledge of history and government, its also about empowering young people to embody constitutional principles like equality, justice, and liberty in their daily lives. \ud83d\udd17 Read more about Civicspalooza and BRIs work:  https://bit.ly/424ZW82  #CivicEducation  #ConstitutionDay  #StudentVoice  #Leadership",
