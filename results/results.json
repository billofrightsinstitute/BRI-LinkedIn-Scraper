Gerald Gangaram, Bill of Rights Institute's Vice President of Civic Leadership Development and former aviation officer in Afghanistan, learned firsthand that being American transcends race, religion, or politics. It's about shared principles like freedom, equality, and justice. \"This Veterans Day, we should all honor the men and women who sacrificed selflessly to preserve our freedom and principles. We should also remember that we can all wear and defend our values, even if we do not all wear uniforms,\" says Gangaram. Today, hes helping BRI empower young people with these same values through civic education. Read more in his recent article,  https://lnkd.in/eRgSTQfM.",
