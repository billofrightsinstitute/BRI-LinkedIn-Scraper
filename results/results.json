Liberty Tutors offers a wide range of Social Studies tutoring and enrichment classes that cater to diverse needs and interests. Here's what founder and teacher Donna Vitek says about BRI: \"As a teacher, I have found the Bill of Rights Institute to be an invaluable resource when teaching Civics, US History, and Constitutional Law. I have found the primary source documents that provide annotations to be very useful for students with learning disabilities. It equalizes the playing field within a classroom for interpreting the information contained in primary source documents. I have seen, first-hand, the confidence in my students abilities increase drastically due to their ability to debate with their peers. Thank you, Bill of Rights Institute!\" To learn more about Liberty Tutors, visit  https://libertytutors.net/  #BillofRightsInstitute  #BRI  #testimonial",
