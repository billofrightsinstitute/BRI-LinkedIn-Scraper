These educators, representing more than 25 states, are inspiring the next generation to see liberty, equality, and civic virtue not just as history, but as living ideals. Each winner receives $300 in recognition of their commitment to bringing the Declaration of Independence to life through adaptable, classroom-ready lessons. As BRI President David Bobb shared, The Civic Star Challenge honors the educators who keep Americas founding principles alive in their classrooms. Their work reminds us that civic knowledge and virtue are essential to sustaining liberty for the next generation.  Congratulations to this first round of winners, and thank you to every teacher who continues to make civic learning a daily act of service. \ud83c\udf1f \ud83d\udd17 Read the full announcement:  https://bit.ly/3LvYuX0  #CivicStarChallenge  #CivicEducation  #America250  #Teachers  #CivicLearning  #EducationLeadership",
