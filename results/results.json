As the 2025 Gary Colletti Scholarship recipient, Katie writes about something many educators rarely get mid-year: a genuine sense of renewal.

C. with no agenda beyond curiosity,  her piece captures what happens when teachers are supported, trusted, and given space to remember why this work matters. If you teach history or civics, this is worth a few minutes of your time:  https://bit.ly/4kIH2vN  #SocialStudies  #CivicEducation  #TeacherDevelopment  #ProfessionalLearning",
