Then GIVE HAPPY to the Bill of Rights Institute through the Combined Federal Campaign using charity code 36265. MyImpact Challenge is a civic engagement contest supported by BRI to create a robust understanding of citizenship and incentivize students to become active in their communities now! One of the great benefits of the CFC is that you can give through payroll deduction or your retiree annuity, giving a little each pay period and supporting BRI's mission all year long.  #GiveCFC  #BRI",
