The statement outlined the colonists' grievances against the British Parliament's Intolerable Acts. Within their grievances, the colonists outlined rights that would evolve into the Bill of Rights. The colonists debated on how to confront the parliamentary acts placed on them by Britain. Including a plan of action, with acts such as boycotting British trade, sending a petition to the King, and publishing addresses, the Declaration and Resolves came to fruition.  https://lnkd.in/eKZiS9kH",

Colletti, a former classroom teacher in New York and Virginia, served as BRIs Director of Teacher and Student Programs before passing away in 2021. He was beloved by students and educators, and meeting fellow teachers at the annual NCSS conference was always one of the highlights of his year.
