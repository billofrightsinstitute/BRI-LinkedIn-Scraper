Students aged 13\u201319 are invited to participate in-person on Saturday, September 13, 2025, at the Dallas Holocaust and Human Rights Museums, where they can showcase community service or entrepreneurship project or pitch an idea to improve your community to earn prizes ranging from $500 to $2,000. Two ways students can participate: 1. Project Trifold (for active projects): Students whove already developed community-focused initiatives can share their projects through a trifold display. Theyll explain their project, tie it back to BRIs principles and virtues,  and visually document its impact. Participants also deliver a 60\u201390 second elevator pitch  to the judges. 2. Pitch Competition (for ideas in progress): If a student has an idea for a civic engagement project but hasnt started yet, they can enter this track. Theyll present the concept, connect it to the founding principles and virtues, and pitch it to judges for the chance to receive up to $250 in seed funding. \ud83d\udcc5 Sept. 13 | 9 AM\u20133 PM \ud83d\udd17 Register now:  https://bit.ly/41boZpC Texas MyImpact Challenge is hosted by the Bill of Rights Institute thanks to our sponsor Travelers.  #CivicEducation  #StudentLeadership  #TexasStudents  #MyImpactChallenge  #StudentGrants",
