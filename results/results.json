David Bobb, President of BRI, joined me on the GDT Podcast to discuss the booming success the organization has achieved by targeting an overlooked area of education and its teachers: American history and civics. Their free curriculum of online resources, videos, and books assist the majority of teachers who want to offer an unbiased presentation of history and the Founding to their students but are hampered by district resources that are inappropriately divisive and technocratic. One of my favorite things about BRIs programs is that they appeal to the artisan nature of good educators and treat them like professionals, rather than cogs in the industrial educational model. This is the foundation of a truly liberal education. To get more information about BRIs innovative work, check out the whole conversation here:  https://lnkd.in/g7HgzH7k",
