C., earlier this month to explore civics, democracy, and Americas unique story. The week was the capstone event for the Bill of Rights Institutes elite Student Fellowship program, a six-month educational program that helps high school students develop as leaders and develop skills in building civil society. The Student Fellows enjoyed a robust itinerary in Philadelphia and Washington, D. C., during their trip. Each day incorporated specific themes, including leadership and the roles of government, the individual, and the entrepreneur in civil society.

Listen to Caroline describe her nonprofit, The World in Us, a youth-to-youth cultural education organization, and the ways in which MyImpact Challenge helped her to connect concepts like citizenship skills and civic virtues to her work. These are foundational skills and ways of thinking that I dont think I would have internalized nearly as much as I have now if not for the MyImpact Challenge,  Gao said.  https://lnkd.in/ebyqpN3X.
