Fr\u00e9mont and Abraham Lincoln and their differing approaches to slavery, emancipation, and presidential power. Drawing from his book Lincolns Pathfinder: John C. Fr\u00e9mont and the Violent Election of 1856, Bicknell discusses Fr\u00e9monts controversial 1861 emancipation proclamation in Missouri, Lincolns revocation of the order, and how the presidents views evolved over timeultimately echoing Fr\u00e9monts justification of military necessity in the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863.
