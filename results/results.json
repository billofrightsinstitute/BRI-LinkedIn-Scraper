Listen to Caroline describe her nonprofit, The World in Us, a youth-to-youth cultural education organization, and the ways in which MyImpact Challenge helped her to connect concepts like citizenship skills and civic virtues to her work. These are foundational skills and ways of thinking that I dont think I would have internalized nearly as much as I have now if not for the MyImpact Challenge,  Gao said.  https://lnkd.in/ebyqpN3X.
